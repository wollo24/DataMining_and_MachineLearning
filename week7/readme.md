# Classification 2

In this week's lab we are going to cover the following topics:

- Introduction to KNN algorithm
- Introduction to Decision Tree algorithm
- Drug classification using KNN and Decision Trees
- Tuning hyperparameters with GridSearch
- Using ColumnTransformer to apply normalisation only to some columns
- Quick reminder/overview on [ROC curve](ROC_AUC.pdf)

### Walkthrough
Follow the notebook [Classification_2.ipynb](https://github.com/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week7/Classification_2.ipynb).

### Exercise (freestyle)
- Create a new notebook 
- Upload the dataset iris by using iris = datasets.load_iris()
- Have a look at the data and do some cleaning, if needed
- Classify the points with KNN, finding the optimal value for k
- Classify the points with Decision Trees as well, finding the optimal depth of the tree.
- Which algorithm provided the best accuracy?


### To do at home
Check out an easy exercise at the end of the walkthrough notebook.
