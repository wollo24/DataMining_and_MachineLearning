# Neural Networks 

In this week's lab we are going to cover the following topics:
- talking about Tensors from PyTorch : [link](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/tensorqs_tutorial.html)
- building a regression model using Pytorch : [Pytorch_regression.ipynb](Pytorch_regression.ipynb)


### To Do
- [nn_exercise.ipynb](nn_exercise_assignment_data.ipynb) : Exercise where you applied have to build a NN model for the datasets we have already seen in previously (["airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv"](../Assignment/Assignment_Q4_to_Q10_2022/airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv) and ["Regression Analysis Data"](../Assignment/Assignment_Q1_to_Q3_2022/Regression%20Analysis%20Data))
