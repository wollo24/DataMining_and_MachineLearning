# Text Analytics 

In this week's lab we are going to cover the following topics:

- Present the Kaggle competition project 
- Text Preparation (e.g. tokenization, lemmatization)
- Text Representation (e.g. Bag of Words, TF-IDF)
- An example of Text Classification

### Walkthrough
Follow the notebook ["Text_Analytics.ipynb"](Text_Analytics.ipynb). Sentiment analysis.

### Exercise
Download an ready-made classifier for sentiment from Huggingface and compare it's accuracy and F1-score to the classifier you built in the walkthrough (for the same data). Which one is better and by how much?

- Notebook [Text_Similarity.ipynb](Text_Similarity.ipynb)
- If we have enough time, this is notebook [Tokenization_stemming_lemmatization.ipynb](Tokenization_stemming_lemmatization.ipynb) is good to train again tokenization stemming and lemmatization.

### Project presentation
Project and kaggle competition. 20% of your project grade will depend on your rank at the kaggle competition.

- 20% Kaggle Rank
- 50% code quality (using classes, splitting into proper files, documentation, etc)
- 30% github quality (15%) + video quality (15%).

Your focus should be on winning kaggle rather than producing a super-perfect video.
The winning team will receive some goodies in the last lecture.
