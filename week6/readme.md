# Classification

In this week's lab we are going to cover the following topics:

- Logistic Regression, a well known method to learn a classification model
- Normalizing numerical features of a dataset before fitting a model
- Encoding categorical features 
- Train and test accuracy to evaluate a classification model
- Precision and Recall, a metric which shows how good our model is in predicting a class label
- Confusion matrix

Some points will be pretty useful for the second part of the assignment. 

### To Do
- Follow the notebook [Classification_Logistic_Regression.ipynb](Classification_Logistic_Regression.ipynb) to learn how to build a complete classification pipeline from scratch.
- Understanding of confusion matrices through an example under the [Confusion_matrix.pdf](Confusion_matrix.pdf). 

Have a look at the two exercise notebooks proposed to gain further insight.

### As an additional exercise 
This notebook [Classification_Exercises.ipynb](Classification_Exercises.ipynb) is available for you to train and get comfortable with classification. Its solution is also available under [Classification_Exercises_sol.ipynb](Classification_Exercises_sol.ipynb).
